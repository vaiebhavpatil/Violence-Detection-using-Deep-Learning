The security surveillance industry faces significant challenges in improving the accuracy, effectiveness, and scalability of security systems, including both hardware and software components. Traditional security surveillance systems struggle with limitations tied to human attention, resulting in potential vulnerabilities and blind spots. Despite their vigilance, human operators are prone to fatigue and distractions, compromising the effectiveness of surveillance efforts. These limitations have profound consequences, especially in a world where data breaches and security incidents have become alarmingly common. In 2020, the average cost associated with a data breach skyrocketed to a staggering $3.86 million, covering direct expenses like investigations and mandatory notifications, along with indirect costs such as lost productivity and damage to reputation. Introducing computer vision technology, a transformative force set to revolutionise security surveillance. At its core, computer vision can automate the labour-intensive processes of monitoring and analysing video feeds, enhancing the capabilities of security systems. Through sophisticated algorithms, computer vision identifies unusual behaviour patterns or events, enabling security personnel to swiftly recognize and address potential threats, thereby reducing the risk of security breaches. Generative AI, a groundbreaking technology, has found its way into the realm of video surveillance systems, marking a significant leap in enhancing security measures. This advanced capability of Generative AI empowers surveillance systems to not only detect threats but also create synthetic content. By leveraging complex algorithms, Generative AI can generate realistic images and videos, aiding in scenarios where real footage might be insufficient or unavailable. This proves invaluable in filling potential blind spots and strengthening overall surveillance capabilities. Generative AI goes beyond traditional methods by creating data rather than relying solely on existing information. This addresses the challenge of limited data availability and enriches the dataset used for training surveillance models. Moreover, Generative AI can simulate various scenarios, preparing security systems to recognize and respond to a broader range of potential threats. This adaptability ensures a more robust and versatile defence against security breaches. In addition to threat detection, the use of Generative AI in video surveillance systems contributes to the automation of tasks such as image enhancement and reconstruction. This not only reduces the burden on security personnel but also ensures that the surveillance system operates at peak performance, even in challenging conditions. The ability of Generative AI to fill gaps in surveillance data and enhance overall system capabilities underscores its pivotal role in fortifying the resilience of digital and physical security domains
